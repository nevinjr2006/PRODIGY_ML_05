ðŸš€ New Project Build: AIâ€‘Powered Food Recognition & Calorie Estimation

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest computer vision projectâ€”a model that can recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, helping users effortlessly track dietary intake and make healthier food choices.

What I Built ðŸ’¡
Data: Used the Foodâ€‘101 dataset (101â€¯K+ images across 101 categories)

Preprocessing: Resized and normalized images; applied augmentations like rotation, flip, zoom

Model: Fineâ€‘tuned a CNN backbone (e.g. ResNet50, MobileNetV2) to classify food

Calorie Layer: Mapped each class to standard caloric values per serving

Next Steps

Integrate portion-size estimation (via depth sensing or CNN-regression)
Wrap into a Streamlit or mobile interface
Expand calorie lookup with USDA or nutrition API
Iterate on multi-task models that predict food type + volume + calories (inspired by state-of-the-art work)

ðŸŽ¯ Impact & Applications

Personal health & fitness tracking
Fitness/nutrition apps
Medical/clinical dietary monitoring tools
